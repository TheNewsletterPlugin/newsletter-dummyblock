# Dummy Composer Block for Newsletter

This is a really simple example on how to create and register a new block for the
Newsletter Composer.

The block will appear in the block list and can be used on every newsletter.

See the `options.php` file to add more options to your block and the `block.php`
file to use them to render the block. 

Remember to add each new option to the default array in `block.php`.
